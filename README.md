# Project Anarchy Virtual Thumb Stick Upgrade

Upgrade for the Project Anarchy `VVirtualThumbStick` C++ class to add more features. 

This class adds the following features to the class:

- **Color** - Set the active and inactive color of the thumbstick images.
- **Priority** - Set the touch area priority which was previously hardcoded to a value of -1500.
- **Right stick emulation** - Emulate a right stick or a left stick, useful if you are making a twin stick shooter.
- **After-touch area adjustment** - Allows increasing the size of the touch area that is used after the user has activated the thumbstick. This can be used if you find that the user is losing their touch without their finger leaving contact with the screen.
